***HELP***

The rules are simple:

Each player will be dealt a random hand of 13 cards.
Each round, the top card will be drawn from each players hand.
The player whose card has the highest value wins the round.
After 13 rounds, the scores are tallied, and a winner is declared.

To play is even simpler:

After each player enters their name, press enter to cycle through 
the rounds. After 13 rounds are completed, a new game can be started 
by entering 'Y' when prompted. To stop playing, enter 'N'.

You can view these rules again by entering '--help' when prompted.
